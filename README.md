## Experience
<div style="text-align:justify">
When my team started making this game, we did not how to begin from. During the project, there was a big problem because we did not know how to create a new map parallel to the first map without error. When my team re-read your slide with the record (overload section), we found a solution to solve the problem and succeeded.
Thanks to this project, my team was able to learn how to use Github (because my team has no experience using Github).
